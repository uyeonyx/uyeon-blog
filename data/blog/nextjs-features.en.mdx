# Next.js 16: The Future of React Development

Next.js has become the go-to framework for building production-ready React applications. Let's explore some of its most powerful features.

## Server Components

React Server Components allow you to render components on the server, reducing the JavaScript bundle size sent to the client.

```jsx
// This is a Server Component by default in Next.js 16
export default async function Page() {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  return <div>{data.title}</div>
}
```

## App Router

The new App Router provides:

- **Layouts**: Share UI across routes
- **Nested Routes**: Organize your app logically
- **Loading States**: Built-in loading UI
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error boundaries

## Image Optimization

The `next/image` component automatically optimizes images:

- Lazy loading
- Responsive images
- WebP format conversion
- Blur placeholder

## Conclusion

Next.js continues to push the boundaries of what's possible with React. Give it a try!
